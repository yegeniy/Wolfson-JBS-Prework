On the Track of Bigfoot

One ((adjective's name)) day, our class went hiking along the ((your city or town)) River. Like all ((2nd adjective)) hikers, we were ready for any emergency. In our backpacks, we carried ((plural noun)), ((food (plural))), and one ((singular noun)).

As we walked along the trail, ((teacher)) noticed a(n) ((adjective)) footprint. “Do you think a(n) ((singular noun)) made these tracks?” ((teacher)) asked.

“No, but let's follow them anyway,” suggested ((friend)).

We ((past tense verb)) for hours. Then I screamed, “((exclamation))! I think I see a huge ((body part (singular))).”

“((favorite expression))!” we heard someone say. It was ((your principal)).

“((your principal))!” we screamed. “We thought you were a huge ((body part (singular)))!”

“Do I look like a huge ((body part (singular)))? Well, as long as you're all here, you can help me look for ((plural noun 2)). There are lots of them here along the ((your city or town)) River. We can take them back to school and study them under our microscopes.”

“((favorite expression))!!” everyonesaid.
